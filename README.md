# Remote Radio
An open source peer to peer audio streaming solution for community radio stations.
***
## Getting Started
In order to start firstly you must enable audio in your browser for the Remote Radio web page. In Chrome this is done by clicking allow on the dialogue box which appears when the page first loads.

After you have enabled audio the user interface will appear. Copy the link from the text box. Send this to the peer you wish to connect with via email, sms or your preferred means. You should now be connected and be able to chat via the chat interface to arrange when to connect etc. Press the call button to start audio transfer.

## Credits

The user interface was developed in collaboration with [Joskaude Pakalkaite](http://joskaudepakalkaite.com)
